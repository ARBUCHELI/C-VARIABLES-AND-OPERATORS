# OPERATORS: LESSON
-------------------

* Overview
----------
In this lesson you will learn about:

	1. performing basic mathematical operations on variables and values using common symbols.

	2. assigning values to variables and/or performing basic mathematical operations using shorthand operations.

	3. comparing two values and/or variables against each other to return a true/false.

	4. using logical operators (and, or, and not).

In the previous lesson, you learned how to create and set variables, but not what you can do with them beyond that. In this lesson, you will learn about modifying variables with the power 
of math, some shorthand assignment methods, and how to compare variables and values. Finally, we will go over how to use logical operators for “and,” “or,” and “not.”

* Mathematical Operations
-------------------------
At their core, computers are basically fancy calculators. So it’s a good thing to learn how to perform basic mathematical operations early on in your language development.

Addition and subtraction work just as you would expect them to. a = 2 + 3 will store 5 in the variable a. You can also use these variables as part of the math (or all of it).

int a = 2;
int b = 3;
int c = a + b;

These same foundational principles of mathematics hold true for subtraction, multiplication, and division.

* Instructions
--------------
Checkpoint 1 Passed
1.
Now we can add a little flavor to our variable knowledge. The program on the right already has the declaration of the variables and some values set, as well as the output to display the 
final results.

Your task is to modify the values stored in the variables using basic mathematical symbols given any changes.

It was a good week, you sold 200 more books! Update the booksSold accordingly.

Checkpoint 2 Passed
2.
Now that you have the updated book sale counts, calculate the totalSalesValue.


Hint
totalSalesValue is the number of books sold (booksSold) times the cost of each book (bookCost).

Checkpoint 3 Passed
3.
Your publisher takes half of the total sales as part of their cut. Update your totalSalesValue accordingly (you can do this with multiplication or division in the real world, but for 
practice, please use division).

Program.c
---------
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  
  // Variables set for you, do not change here
  int booksSold = 100;
  double bookCost = 9.99;
  double totalSalesValue;

  // Make your changes here
  booksSold = booksSold + 200;
  totalSalesValue = booksSold * bookCost;
  totalSalesValue = totalSalesValue/2;
  // Output logic, no need to change this
  printf("You sold %d books and your take home was $%.2f\n", booksSold, totalSalesValue);
}
